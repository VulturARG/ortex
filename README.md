## PYTHON PROGRAMMING EXERCISE 1

### Introduction
Thank you for doing our programming exercise. The task at hand is to use Python to read a csv file and calculate some values. The solution should use python 3.x and no external libraries, only the python standard library. It is expected to take about an hour to complete the exercise.
Data
Attached is a csv file with insider transactions in multiple stocks and exchanges, each line corresponds to one transaction. The file is provided with headers, the headers are self-descriptive, but if you do not know what they mean that does not matter for the exercise. 

### Tasks
The application should be able to calculate and write out the answers to the below questions. 

1. What Exchange has had the most transactions in the file? 

2. In August 2017, which companyName had the highest combined valueEUR?

3. For 2017, only considering transactions with tradeSignificance 3, what is the percentage of transactions per month?

We expect a list as per below:

    Jan, 10%
    Feb, 5%
