The first time I solved the exercise 1, I developed two approaches to solving the problem because the goal of this exercise is to demonstrate software development knowledge.

The first option, used to answer questions 1 and 2, I called it **Do it yourself**. It uses few features of python so it can be easily ported to other languages.

The second option was a more **pythonics** development, using more python features.

In this opportunity, I used a new architectural approach, that was implemented in my current job after I made the first test. We start to decoupling logic from frameworks using the principles of **hexagonal architecture**. I adapted my previous develop with some few code refactors to this concept.
